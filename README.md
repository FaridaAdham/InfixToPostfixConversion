# InfixToPostfixConversion
Command Prompt Program in C implementing the Infix to Postfix conversion and calculates the result.
This algorithm converts an infix expression into a postfix expression. It uses a stack; but in this case, the stack is used to hold operators rather than numbers. The purpose of the stack is to reverse the order of the operators in the expression. It also serves as a storage structure, since no operator can be printed until both of its operands have appeared.
